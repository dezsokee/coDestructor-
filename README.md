### Don't waste your food!  

Our objective during the 3rd Make It Easy Hackathon was to develop a mobile application aimed at mitigating food waste within our community.
  
Within the application, users have the capability to choose surplus ingredients they wish to receive missions for. These missions comprise recipes, completion of which earns users various points. These points can then be utilized to avail discounts. Moreover, each month features a designated national cuisine, the recipes of which will be integrated into the quests, complementing the selected ingredients of the user.

A new look is being planned ðŸ‘‡
